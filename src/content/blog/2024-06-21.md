## Desert

Desert Egypt location, a hot and arid desert land, covered with sand and rock formations. It's a place where travelers and adventurers can find rare and valuable goods and treasures. The location is full of caves and pyramids, abandoned by the ancient Egyptians. The climate is extremely hot during the day and very cold at night, so it's important to be prepared for both conditions.
