# New Level Blockout Complete: Zombie Dusty Quarry

We are pleased to announce that our Lead Artist has completed the blockout for the latest level: Zombie Dusty Quarry. This blockout establishes the foundational geometry, layout, and key sightlines for the level, ensuring it captures the eerie, abandoned atmosphere that players will experience.

The quarry is designed to evoke tension and suspense, with narrow paths, hidden vantage points, and open areas prone to ambush. The levelâ€™s structure supports strategic gameplay, encouraging exploration while maintaining a constant sense of danger.

Next steps include detailing, asset placement, and lighting adjustments to bring the zombie-infested quarry to life.
