## Improved master materials for originally-looking enviroment

<!-- Implementing master material in UE5 -->

The Master Material is a powerful feature in Unreal Engine 5 that allows you to create highly customizable materials without the need for art. With the Master Material, you can control every aspect of the material, from its appearance to its lighting behavior. You can create master materials in the Content Browser by right-clicking on the Materials folder and selecting "Create Master Material". Once created, you can customize the material by adjusting its properties in the Details panel. The Master Material is a versatile tool that can be used to create a wide range of materials, from simple shiny surfaces to complex, detailed textures.
